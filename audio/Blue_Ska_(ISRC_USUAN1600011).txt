Description 	
English: Blue Ska
Run of the mill ska!? No such thing! Well, this is as close to that reality as you can get. It is high energy, dance-inducing, happy fun times for everyone who was born after... like... the Industrial Revolution... So, there may be some trees and fungi that don't find this fun; but, I can't really care about their concepts of fun too much. I assume they don't like winters, but they just all sort of stand around all the time.
